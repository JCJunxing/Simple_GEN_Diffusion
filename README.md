# Diffusion Model Notebook

This Jupyter notebook details the implementation of a diffusion model using PyTorch, a popular deep learning library. The notebook is structured into key sections as follows:

## Sections:
A Diffusion Model from Scratch in PyTorch - Introduction and overview of building a diffusion model from scratch.
Investigating the dataset - Analysis of the Stanford Cars Dataset which comprises approximately 8000 images in the training set.
## Building the Diffusion Model:
Step 1: The forward process and noise scheduler.
Further steps involve modifications to the dataset such as image resizing, conversion to tensors, etc.
## Dataset:
The Stanford Cars Dataset is utilized in this notebook, focusing on its application in training the diffusion model.

## Instructions:
Ensure PyTorch is installed.
Download the Stanford Cars Dataset.
Follow the notebook steps for implementing the model.
This notebook is intended for educational purposes, providing insights into the construction and training of a diffusion model with a practical dataset.
